# ClashMimo

</div>

<br>

ClashMimo is a cross-platform desktop proxy client for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Import Clash-standard and Base64 subscriptions. It starts quickly and uses little resources. On Windows and macOS, platform-level frosted window effects are available, with a simple native look.

It also ships with a large set of simulation and prewritten test flows that walk through real user actions, so ongoing maintenance stays easier.

## 🚀 Quick Start

<sub>[↑ Back to Navigation](#navigation)</sub>

1. Launch the app and import your subscription or config file.
2. Select nodes on the Nodes page; set an outbound mode on the Home page (Rule / Global / Direct).
3. Enable system proxy or virtual network mode for full-device traffic coverage.

Config format is fully compatible with Clash Meta — see the [mihomo documentation](https://wiki.metacubex.one/en/config/) for details.

## ❓ FAQ

<sub>[↑ Back to Navigation](#navigation)</sub>

### App will not start or appears unresponsive after installation?

Install the .NET 11 Runtime, then start ClashMimo again:

- General: [Microsoft download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/11.0)
- Arch Linux and derivatives: AUR package [`dotnet-core-preview-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dotnet-core-preview-bin)

### UWP Loopback & Administrator Privileges

UWP apps on Windows (e.g. Microsoft Store apps) are blocked from accessing the local proxy loopback address by default. ClashMimo provides a **UWP loopback exemption** toggle to remove this restriction.

Notes:

- Administrator privileges are usually not required; the system only prompts for elevation when permission is insufficient.
- Virtual network mode is unaffected — it takes over traffic at the adapter level and never goes through loopback.
- If you use system proxy mode and want UWP apps (such as Microsoft Store apps) to go through the proxy, turn this option on.

### Do system proxy / virtual network require admin?

- **System proxy**: No administrator privileges required.
- **Virtual network**: Creating a virtual network adapter requires administrator privileges. Install service mode on first use to avoid repeated UAC prompts.
- **UWP loopback exemption** (Windows): usually no administrator privileges required; elevate only if permission is insufficient.

## 🛠 Development Guide

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Get it |
|---|---|---|
| .NET SDK | `11.0.x` | https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/11.0 |
| Rust | stable (rustup) | https://rustup.rs |
| Python | `3.x` | https://www.python.org/downloads/ |

### Architecture

Modular monolith + Clean Architecture + MVVM.

```
src/ClashMimo.Desktop         Avalonia host, windows, platform services
src/ClashMimo.Presentation    ViewModels, UI state, command bindings
src/ClashMimo.Application     Use cases, service & capability interfaces
src/ClashMimo.Domain          Entities, value objects, domain rules
src/ClashMimo.Infrastructure  File system, persistence, external services
src/ClashMimo.Native          C# wrappers over the native FFI layer
native/hub                      Native library: config override, parsing, capabilities
native/service                  Service mode
scripts/                        build.py · prebuild.py · test.py
```

Dependency direction: `Desktop → Presentation → Application → Domain`

`Infrastructure` and `Native` implement interfaces defined by `Application`; `Application` has no dependency on desktop, Avalonia, or FFI details.

Prohibited:

- Views accessing databases, file system, or Rust FFI directly
- ViewModels holding platform APIs, file paths, or window lifecycle details
- Domain depending on Avalonia, databases, networking, logging, or config files
- Rust crates being aware of C#, Avalonia, or window lifecycle

### C# Conventions

**Naming**

- Types, enums, interfaces, properties, methods: `PascalCase`
- Local variables, parameters, private instance fields: `camelCase`; private readonly instance fields: `_camelCase`
- Interfaces use `I` prefix only when expressing an abstract capability
- Async methods end with `Async`; cancellable operations take `CancellationToken`
- Booleans use affirmative semantics: `IsEnabled`, `CanSave`, `HasSelection`

**Practices**

- Use `var` when the type is obvious from the right side; explicit types otherwise
- Use result objects for complex state (`SaveResult`, `ParseResult`), not bare `bool`
- Guard clauses at system boundaries; no excessive defensiveness for impossible internal states
- Never use `.Result` or `.Wait()` to block async tasks
- Comments state intent, constraints, and pitfalls; concise, max 2 lines per block

### Rust Conventions

**Naming**

- crate, module, function, variable: `snake_case`
- type, trait, enum, struct: `PascalCase`
- const, static: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`

**Practices**

- Immutable by default, prefer borrowing
- Use `Result<T, E>` and `?` for error propagation; no `unwrap()` for recoverable errors
- `unsafe` is prohibited by default; when necessary, minimize scope and comment the safety precondition
- No `mod.rs` — use Rust 2018+ same-name file style
- FFI function naming: `hub_<capability>_<action>`

**Capability module structure**

```
native/hub/src/
├── lib.rs              // module declarations only
├── ffi.rs              // root FFI aggregation
├── capabilities/       // one file per capability
├── infra/              // HTTP client, runtime, etc.
└── util/               // pure utility functions
```

### Avalonia / MVVM

- Views handle display and binding only — no business logic
- ViewModels expose immutable or observable state; never manipulate control instances directly
- UI thread handles UI updates only; heavy work goes to background threads
- Platform capabilities (windows, tray, permissions) are implemented in the host layer and exposed via `Application` interfaces

### Control Test IDs

All interactive controls must have `AutomationProperties.AutomationId` set.

- Format: `PageOrArea.SemanticName`, e.g. `Main.SaveButton`, `Library.SearchBox`
- IDs are stable — they don't change with display text, language, or layout
- No duplicates within the same View
- No random numbers, indices, or visual-position naming

### Build & Test

Development workflow: **prebuild → test → build**.

#### 1. Prebuild

Downloads the core binary, GeoIP data, and fonts; builds the service-mode binary.

```bash
python scripts/prebuild.py
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| *(default)* | Release service binary |
| `--dev` | Debug service binary |
| `--all` | Both Debug and Release |
| `--platform <rid>` | `current` · `win-x64` · `win-arm64` · `linux-x64` · `linux-arm64` · `macos-x64` · `macos-arm64` |
| `--clean` | Clean `build/` and `bin/obj/` before fetching |

#### 2. Test

```bash
python scripts/test.py --all
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `<name>` | Run a specific test by name |
| `--all` | Run every pre-build test |
| `--rust` | Run only Rust scenario integration tests |
| `--csharp` | Run only C# business tests |

**Rust scenario tests:**

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `empty-start` | Hub IPC starts the core with an empty config |
| `hub-ipc-contract` | IPC contract: methods, fields, error codes, lifecycle |
| `yaml-override` | YAML override output verification |
| `js-override` | JS override output verification |
| `combo` | Combined YAML + JS override chain |
| `config-switch` | `apply_config` switches config while core is running |

**C# business tests:**

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `proxy-selection` | Default nodes, fixed groups, persistence, sync, outbound mode |
| `proxy-page` | Groups, node switching, search, sorting, delay tests |
| `home-state` | System proxy, virtual network, outbound mode, runtime refresh, service mode |
| `shell-navigation` | Page visibility, settings navigation, localization refresh |
| `runtime-config` | Ports, DNS overrides, virtual network, LAN, external controller, transforms |
| `core-ipc-contract` | C# wrapper methods, parameters, response parsing, error codes |
| `chain-proxy` | Detection, disabling, custom chain generation, naming conflicts |
| `monitoring-pages` | Connection/log/rule parsing, pause, filtering, closing, refresh |
| `subscription-page` | Add, edit, override selection, chain proxy, update, scheduling |
| `override-page` | Validation, import, save, reference cleanup, ordering, metadata |
| `settings-page` | Core config, permissions, data management, language, theme |
| `webdav` | Connection validation, folder creation, upload, list, download, delete |

#### 3. Build

```bash
python scripts/build.py
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| *(default)* | Release build |
| `--dev` | Debug build |
| `--all` | Both Debug and Release |
| `--platform <rid>` | Same as prebuild, plus `desktop` (win-x64 + linux-x64 + macos-arm64) |
| `--pack <format>` | `zip` · `installer` · `all` |
| `--clean` | Clean target output directory before building |

**Full release build:**

```bash
python scripts/prebuild.py
python scripts/build.py --pack all
```

#### Formatting

```bash
dotnet format
cargo fmt
```

## 📋 PR Guidelines

<sub>[↑ Back to Navigation](#navigation)</sub>

Before submitting a Pull Request, confirm the following:

### Requirements

Pull Requests must target `beta`. Direct Pull Requests to `stable` are prohibited; only the repository owner may promote the repository's `beta` branch to `stable`.

| Check | Description |
|---|---|
| Debug commands | New or modified business logic must be wrapped as debug commands under `src/ClashMimo.Desktop/Debug` |
| Control IDs | New interactive controls must have `AutomationProperties.AutomationId` set |
| Pre-merge tests | Must include pre-tests or simulation tests to ensure independent verification before merge |
| Formatting | C#: `dotnet format`, Rust: `cargo fmt` |

### Debug Command Requirements

Debug commands are wrapped under `src/ClashMimo.Desktop/Debug` and invoked through the debug control port. When business logic changes, add or update the corresponding `Debug/Commands/*.cs` implementation.

### Control ID Requirements

When adding clickable, input-capable, selectable, or state-assertable controls:

```xml
<Button AutomationProperties.AutomationId="Settings.SaveButton" />
<TextBox AutomationProperties.AutomationId="Subscription.UrlInput" />
```

Naming rule: `PageOrArea.SemanticName` — stable, unique, independent of visual layout.
